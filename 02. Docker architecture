🧱 **1. Docker Client (CLI)**
- This is what **you interact with** when you run commands like:
  ```
  docker run
  docker build
  docker pull
  ```
- The Docker Client sends these commands to the **Docker Daemon** using REST APIs.

---

## ⚙️ **2. Docker Daemon (dockerd)**
- This is the **core service** running in the background.
- It **builds, runs, and manages containers** based on the commands it receives.
- It handles:
  - Pulling images
  - Creating and managing containers
  - Managing networks, volumes, etc.

---

## 🛠️ **3. Docker Engine**
- This is the **entire Docker system** installed on your machine.
- It includes:
  - **Docker Daemon**
  - **Docker CLI**
  - **Docker REST API**
- So basically:
  ```
  Docker Engine = Docker CLI + Docker Daemon + API
  ```

---

## 📦 **4. Docker Objects**
These are the things Docker works with:

### a. **Images**
- The blueprint or template for containers.
- Includes app code, dependencies, and configuration.

### b. **Containers**
- Running instances of Docker images.
- They are lightweight, isolated environments.

### c. **Volumes**
- Used for persistent data storage (so data is not lost when containers stop).

### d. **Networks**
- Allow communication between containers.

---

## 🌐 **5. Docker Registry**
- A repository for Docker images (like **Docker Hub**).
- You can **pull** images from it, or **push** your own images to share with others.

---

## 🔁 **How It All Works (Flow)**

```
You (User)
   ↓
Docker CLI (Client)
   ↓
Docker Daemon (dockerd)
   ↓
Images ↔ Containers ↔ Volumes ↔ Networks
   ↕
Docker Registry (e.g., Docker Hub)
```

Let me know if you’d like a diagram or a real-world example (like running a Node.js app in Docker) to understand it even better!
